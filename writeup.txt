Our Custom Object & Interaction :

1. Growing Plants
   As you works inside the CSE laboratory, the time will pass quickly as well as the surroundings
so that the plants will grow to a incredible scale from a small seed as times passes by.

2. DeadLine AI following
   As we all know, EECS students are pushing by all kinds of deadlines, so that a board with deadline
will follow you up no matter where you goes, it may be somewhat cute at first but will definitely annoy
you when it disturbs you all the time.

3. Doctor Strangeâ€˜s cape and portals
    You accidentally find a wierd cape, seemingly like the one of Doctor Stranges, when you interact with 
it and put it on, you will find three magical fantastic portals visible to you in the laboratory!! You 
can quickly shuttle through them to save your time when working!! However, no matter where you go , your
deadline will still detect and catch you!!

4. Collapsing laboratory in another universe
    When you excitedly travel through the portals, possibility is that you may be accidentally transported
to the roof of the building and up there exists another mysterious portal. When you go across, you will be 
inside a CSE laboratory in another universe! However, the world is collapsing and you know you should leave
as quickly as possible, then you leave the room interacting with the door, the later story......
